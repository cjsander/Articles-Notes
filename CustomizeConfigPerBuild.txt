Web.Config Transform:
1. Open Build --> Configuration Manager
2. Create new "Active solution configuration" for each version you need and then close.
3. Navigate to Solution Explorer and right-click on your web.config and select "Add Config Transform."  This should generate the new config files you created in Configuration Manager.
4. Open the transform file for the build configuration that you want to work with.
