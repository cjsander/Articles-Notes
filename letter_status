CURRENT STANCE:

Ajay remains on the top of my most respected public figures while others are gone.  MC has given me personal, professional, 
technical skills that I have added to my wealth of experience and will take with me wherever I go.

Given the past 18 months or so I have no idea where I will end up next but I do know where I’m staying.  I will
continue to give all that I can to those around me whom I support and those who have most certainly supported me in grief, loss, trauma, and celebrations.  This includes taking care of myself as well.  89 days.  I can’t remove this as a top priority, even if it means I’m not visibly advancing my career, the child I’ve nurtured for most of my life, as others would like me to do.  

This said, I will likewise not change my work priorities.  Regardless of team or company, I will still be giving 100% towards our goals.  
I’m no longer going to try as many extra-curricular activities at work but instead focus on my primary responsibilities. 
I’m very sorry that I haven’t been reaching my potential and completely using my capabilities to help my team better.  
For now, I can only commit to continue fighting along with them with the longer-term goal to lead, advance, and advocate for them.  

Dependent on the opportunity, I am currently open to the following within D&S/MC
Stepping down to a different level
Making a lateral move
Dependent on the options, I will not
Re-locate to the STL office to a situation similar to what I left
